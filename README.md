# Sign-Language-Recognition-System-
The goal of this project is to build a system capable of recognizing and classifying hand gestures used in sign language (American Sign Language in this case). By capturing hand landmarks and training a machine learning model, the system can predict the corresponding sign language character, helping to translate hand gestures into meaningful text
